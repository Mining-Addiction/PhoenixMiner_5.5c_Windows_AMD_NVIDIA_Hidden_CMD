1. Allow miner in Anti Virus as it will show as a false positive due to its coin mining nature.
2. To start the miner in hidden mode use start_hidden_mode and the miner will start in an invisable window hidden away perfect for anyone that wants to run PhoenixMiner in a hidden CMD terminal.

Miner Copies its self to the Windows program of user system and uses NirCMD to hide the mining window.

Remember to change the mining wallet address. If you want to support this repo leave the miner running a little while thanks.
